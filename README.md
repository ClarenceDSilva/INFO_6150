# codesByClarenceDsilva

This repository is basically a compilaion of everything I have done which has involved the use of code (well almost :P).
Some codes predate even before the creation of this repository.
The repository contains codes from both spectrums, significant as well as insignificant, minor test codes ranging from
small web-page assignments to Univesity projects and to hobby coding.
Im, glad to have you look at it.
